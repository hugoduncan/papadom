# papadom

Use html pages as templates for your clojurescript applications.

The library is based on html being the defining source for both the visual
appearance of you application, and the events that drive it.  Events are
delivered via `core.async` channels.

**EXPERIMENTAL**

## Usage

Papadom uses custom attributes to recognise templates and elements that should
generate events when the user interacts with them.  See the example
[todo app page](examples/todo/resources/public/index.html).

## Recognised Attributes

`t-content`
: declares a template scope that will be passed a map of values that may be used
in mustache type template expressions.  The value of the`t-content` is the name
of the template.

`t-template`
: declares a template scope that will be passed a sequence of values.  For each
element in the sequnce, the contents of the element with the `t-template`
attribute will be rendered.  The element of the sequence becomes the current
expression for mustache type template expressions.  The value of the
`t-template` is both the name of the expression to iterate over, and the name
of the template.

`t-scope`
: within a `t-content` or `t-template` element, this can be used to further
narrow the current expression for mustache type template expressions.

`t-event`
: used to indicate that the element should generate an event.  The attribute
value becomes the name of the event.

`t-id`
: used with elements having a `t-event` attribute.  Specifies a comma
separated list of attribute names to be passed in the event data.

## Clojurescript functions

The `papadom.template` namespace provides functions for interacting with the
templates from within your application.  See the example
[todo app code](examples/todo/src/papadom/example/todo.cljs).

The `compile-templates` function must be called first, in order to compile the
templates in the current page.

The `template-events` is called with a `core.async` channel which is configured
to receive events from `t-event` annotated elements.  You're application reads
events from the event channel, modifies it's internal state, calling `render`
to re-display the templates based on that state.

## JavaScript dependencies

**NOTE: the js dpendencies aren't working yet!**

Papadom uses `handlebars.js` and `jquery.js`.  You can provide these yourself,
or add the following to your lein-cljsbuild `:compiler` configuration maps, and
require the`papadom.js.handlebars` and `papadom.js.jquery` namespaces.

```clj
:foreign-libs
  [{:file "papadom/js/jquery.js"
    :provides ["papadom.js.jquery"]}
   {:file "papadom/js/handlebars.js"
    :provides ["papadom.js.handlebars"]}]
```
