# papadom

Use html pages as templates for your clojurescript applications.

The library is based on html being the defining source for both the visual
appearance of you application, and the events that drive it.  Events are
delivered via `core.async` channels.

**EXPERIMENTAL**

*NOTE: the tests don't run yet due to js packaging issues!*

## Usage

Papadom uses custom attributes to recognise templates and elements that should
generate events when the user interacts with them.  See the example
[todo app page](examples/todo/resources/public/index.html).

There is also an introductory [blog post][papadomblog].

## Recognised Attributes

`t-content`
: declares a template scope that will be passed a map of values that may be used
in mustache type template expressions.  The value of the`t-content` is the name
of the template.

`t-template`
: declares a template scope that will be passed a sequence of values.  For each
element in the sequnce, the contents of the element with the `t-template`
attribute will be rendered.  The element of the sequence becomes the current
expression for mustache type template expressions.  The value of the
`t-template` is both the name of the expression to iterate over, and the name
of the template.

`t-scope`
: within a `t-content` or `t-template` element, this can be used to further
narrow the current expression for mustache type template expressions.

`t-event`
: used to indicate that the element should generate an event.  The attribute
value becomes the name of the event.

`t-id`
: used with elements having a `t-event` attribute.  Specifies a comma
separated list of attribute names to be passed in the event data.

## Clojurescript functions

The `papadom.template` namespace provides functions for interacting with the
templates from within your application.  See the example
[todo app code](examples/todo/src/papadom/example/todo.cljs).

The `compile-templates` function must be called first, in order to compile the
templates in the current page.

The `template-events` is called with a `core.async` channel which is configured
to receive events from `t-event` annotated elements.  You're application reads
events from the event channel, modifies it's internal state, calling `render`
to re-display the templates based on that state.

## JavaScript Libraries

Papadom uses handlebars.js and jQuery.  Since we use jQuery via jayq, it has to
be specified as a `&lt;script&gt;` tag in the browser.

You can provide `handlebars.js` in several ways.

See [Luke Vanderhart's post][lukespost] for a general introduction to using
Javascript libraries in Clojurescript.

### SCRIPT Link in the HTML Page

You can add a `<script>` links in the applications web page to provide
handlebars.js.  In this case you should create an empty `papadom.js.jquery`
namespace.

To use `:optimizations` other than `:whitespace` with this approach, you will
need to add `:externs` to the `:compiler` map in you cljsbuild definitions.

### Use :foreign-libs with Papadom Provided Versions

To use the versions of the handlebars.js included with Papadom, add the
following to your lein-cljsbuild `:compiler` configuration maps.

```clj
:foreign-libs
  [{:file "papadom/js/handlebars.js"
    :provides ["papadom.js.handlebars"]}]
```

### Use :foreign-libs with Custom Versions

Add your own versions of handlebars.js as a resource, and add
`:foreign-libs` definitions as above, but with the `:file` value pointing to the
classpath relative path for your versions of the libraries.
